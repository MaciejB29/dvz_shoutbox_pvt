FOLLOW THIS STEPS, OR YOUR DVZ SHOUTBOX WIL NOT WORK!!!!!!

1. Put all the files in the right place.
2. Put the CSS from CSS.txt in your global.css. (!This CSS is responsive!)
3. Activate the two plugins.
4. Rename the tables mybb_shoutbox_reports and mybb_shoubox_reports_banned 
to mybb_mybb_shoutbox_reports and mybb_mybb_shoutbox_reports_banned,
basically, just double your prefix in the name of these tables!
